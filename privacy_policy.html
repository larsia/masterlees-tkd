	<p>Jul 31, 2020</p>

	<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD ("<strong>2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>"), we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

	<ul>
		<li dir="ltr">We don't ask you for personal information unless we 
truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like 
your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
		<li dir="ltr">We don't share your personal information with anyone 
except to comply with the law, develop or operate our products or 
services, or protect our rights.</li>
		<li dir="ltr">We don't store personal information on our servers or 
the offsite servers of the third-party service providers we use to 
provide our core services unless required for the on-going operation of 
one of our services.</li>
		<li dir="ltr">In our social networking and mobile application 
products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control 
what is visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and
 permanently deleted.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 style="color: #485F75; font-weight: normal;">Below is our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") which incorporates these goals:</h4>

	<p>2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD operates a mobile application (the 
"Application"). It is 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD's policy to respect the 
privacy of the Application's users ("<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>your</strong>") regarding any information collected through the Application.</p>

	<h4 style="color: #485F75;">Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

	<p>2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD collects, or may have a third-party service 
providers collect, non-personally-identifying information of the sort 
that mobile applications typically make available, such as the type of 
device using the Application, the operating system, location 
information, and aggregated user statistics. For instance, 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD may monitor the most popular features of the Application. 
2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying 
information is to better understand how users utilize the Application. 
From time to time, 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD may release 
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by 
publishing or disclosing to third parties a report on trends in the 
usage of the Application or of mobile applications including the 
Application.</p>

	<h4 style="color: #485F75;">Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

	<p dir="ltr">Certain users of the Application choose to interact with 
2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD in ways that require 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD to gather
 personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information 
that 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD gathers depends on the nature of the 
interaction. For example, we ask users who log in to a social network 
through the Application to provide a username and an email address. 
Those who engage in transactions with 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD are asked to 
provide additional personally-identifying information, including, as 
necessary, their first and last name, physical address, telephone 
number, and additional data such as financial information required to 
process those transactions. In each case, 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD collects 
such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill 
the purpose of the user interaction with 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD. 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD does not share personally-identifying information other 
than as described below. Users can always refuse to supply 
personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent 
them from engaging in certain Application-related activities.&nbsp;</p>

	<h4 style="color: #485F75;">Sharing of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

	<p>2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD shares personally-identifying information only 
with those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations 
that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD's behalf or to provide services available through the 
Application, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. For
 instance, 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD uses third-party vendors and hosting 
partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, data 
storage, and related technology required to run the services available 
through the Application. Some of those employees, contractors and 
affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. 
2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD will not rent or sell personally-identifying 
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and 
affiliated organizations, as described above, 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD 
discloses personally-identifying information only when required to do so
 by law, or when 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD believes in good faith that 
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD, third parties or the public at large.</p>

protect your personally identifiable information against unauthorized 
access, use, alteration, loss, or destruction.</p>

	<h4 style="color: #485F75;">Do-Not-Track Disclosures</h4>

	<p>Neither 2020 Master Lee's World Champion TKD nor any third party engages in the 
collection of personally-identifiable information about your online 
activities over time and across third-party websites or online services 
when you are accessing or using the Application. For this reason, the

mechanisms providing you the ability to exercise choice regarding the 
collection of such information.</p>
